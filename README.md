# BORPIC-PP-MATLAB-CODE
There are four zip files in this repository.
Each zip file includes MATLAB source codes and input mesh data.

1. BORPIC-PP-MATLAB-code-TM-phi-Line-Source-EM-Simulations: 
This code describes the EM radiation physics from a azimuthal current flowing on a infinintely long cylinder in a meridian (z\rho) plane.  
2. BORPIC-PP-MATLAB-code-TE-phi-Line-Source-EM-Simulations:
This code describes the EM radiation physics from a axial current (along z direction) flowing on a infinintely long cylinder in a meridian (z\rho) plane.  
3. BORPIC-PP-MATLAB-code-TM-phi-Single-Particle-PIC-Simulations:
This code describes the self EM fields produced by a moving charged ring. In the charged ring we assumed that electrons are constantly moving azimuthally so that each charged ring can be thought of as a current loop.
These physics can be simulated in the BORPIC++ with TM-phi polarization code.
4. BORPIC-PP-MATLAB-code-TE-phi-Single-Particle-PIC-Simulations:
This code describes the self EM fields produced by a moving charged ring. The motions of the charged ring on the meridian plane are modeled by axial and radial current sources which generate the self-EM fields.
Physically speaking, we are modeling expanding and shrinking charged rings and their EM fields.
These physics can be simulated in the BORPIC++ with TE-phi polarization code.
